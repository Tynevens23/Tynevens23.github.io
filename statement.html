  <h1>Artist Statement</h1>
  <p>For my art, I wanted to make things out of art by the things i really enjoy in my life. Sort of like my hobbies and sometimes maybe my belief.At the same time i want to introduce it to an audience in a way that they would want to get into it themselves. Throught this course i really bonded with coding. I t was something tat i was always interested in and wanted to learn so much more about. Having a complete understanding of code allows me to create anything that I can think of.</p>
  <p> For my personal favorites pieces I mostly focused on code. My clock project I used a pre example of a code of a clock and try to add my own modifications for it. With already see the pre existing code of the clock already I had an idea of what i want to do with it and i would add my own variables to it and try to interpret it with a complete new appearance. For my Final project, I used two different codes of classic games and tried to combine them together to create a complete new aspect of a game. With games in genreal code is really important and me fitting right in that category of playing with game codes made me run my imagination wild.
